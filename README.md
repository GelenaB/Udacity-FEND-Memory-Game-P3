## Overview

The deck contains 16 cards, 8 of which are identical. Your task is to flip, memorise and match identical cards with the lowest amount of moves possible.

You start off with 3 stars. The number of stars will start gradually decreasing if you're making too many moves without matching cards.

## Acknowledgements

This is my first complex project that is heavily dependent on JavaScript.

The started code was provided by Udacity: https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

Udacity's online community and Codebar's Tutors were a massive help. One of the students Yayha Elharony recorded an amazing explanation of how to tackle the JS logic behind the game.
