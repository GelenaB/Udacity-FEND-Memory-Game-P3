## Game Overview

The deck contains 16 cards, 8 of which are identical. Your task is to flip, memorise and match identical cards with the lowest amount of moves possible.

You start off with 3 stars. The number of stars will start gradually decreasing if you're making too many moves without matching cards.

This is my first complex project that is heavily dependent on JavaScript.

The started code was provided by Udacity: https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

Udacity's online community was a massive help and one of the students Yayha Elharony recorded an amazing explanation of how to tackle the JS logic behind the game. His webinar is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8J13lmApkQ&feature=youtu.be&t=9
